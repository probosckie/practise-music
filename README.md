# practise-music
A small program which shows random chords and other things at an interval - to practise.

I started learning the piano a few weeks back and I wanted to practise random chords or diatonic chords within a scale or 7th chords of a scale.

So I created (wrote them - not used a LLM ) - to give me these things.

They are editable. Can be applied to guitar chords as well.
